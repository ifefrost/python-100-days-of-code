Stock Trading News Alert

## Project Description:
This program checks the stock growth of a hardcoded stock using the Alpha Vantage API. If the stock has grown by more than 5% in the last 24 hours, the program will use the News API to check for the top 3 news articles about the stock. If the articles contain the word "Tesla", the program will send an SMS message to the user to check the news.
