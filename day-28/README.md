## Project Name:
Pomodoro Timer

## Project Description:
This project is a simple Pomodoro timer. The program uses the Tkinter module to create a GUI. The program uses the Canvas widget to display an image on the screen. It counts down 4 intervals of 25 minutes with 5 minute short breaks inbetween and a long 20 minute break. The program uses the Canvas widget to display the time remaining in the current interval and adds a checkmark for each completed interval. An executable file is included which can be run on Windows.
