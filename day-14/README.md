## Project Name:
Higher Lower Game

## Project Description:
This project is a simple text-based higher lower game. It asks the user to guess which of two Instagram accounts has more followers. It then checks if the user's guess is correct. If it is, it prints out a message saying the user won. If it isn't, it tells the user if their guess was too high or too low. It then asks the user if they want to play again. If they do, it asks them to guess which of two Instagram accounts has more followers. If they don't, it prints out a message saying goodbye.
