## Project Name:
Hangman

## Project Description:
This project is a simple text-based hangman game. It asks the user to guess a letter. If the letter is in the word, it prints out the word with the letter filled in. If the letter is not in the word, it prints out the word with a blank space where the letter should be. It then asks the user to guess another letter. It repeats this process until the user has guessed all the letters in the word or until the user has guessed 6 incorrect letters. If the user guesses all the letters in the word, it prints out a message saying they won. If the user guesses 6 incorrect letters, it prints out a message saying they lost.
