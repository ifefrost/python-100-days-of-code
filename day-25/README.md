# Completed Day 25

## Topics:
- Reading and Writing to CSV Files
- Working with Pandas DataFrames

## Project Name:
U.S. States Game

## Project Description:
This project is a simple game that uses the Turtle module to display a map of the United States. It uses the pandas module to read the csv file containing the names of the states and their coordinates. It then compares user entry with the names of the states in the csv file. If the user entry matches a state name in the csv file, the state name is displayed on the map. If the user entry does not match a state name in the csv file, the game ends and the names of the states that were not guessed are written to a csv file.
