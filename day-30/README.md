## Project Name:
Password Manager (Part 2)

## Project Description:
This was an improvement on the password manager from day 29. The program now uses a JSON file to store the data. It also uses try/except/else/finally to handle errors and exceptions. I added a search function to allow users to search for their passwords from the saved data.
