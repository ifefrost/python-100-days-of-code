## Project Name:
Number Guessing Game

## Project Description:
This project is a simple text-based number guessing game. It asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. It then checks if the user's guess is correct. If it is, it prints out a message saying the user won. If it isn't, it tells the user if their guess was too high or too low. It then asks the user if they want to play again. If they do, it asks them to guess a number between 1 and 100. If they don't, it prints out a message saying goodbye.
